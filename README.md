# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Abstract:
This project is an interactive 2 player tic-tac-toe game.  The interface allows the user to place tokens in empty spaces on the game board. The data model keeps track of the token placement and wins of each player.  The DOM displays wins for each player, current players turn and the outcome of the game Win/Loose/Draw.  The game board is reset at the conclusion of the game.

### Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical c challenge

### Wins + Challenges:

- Wins
  - I was able to complete all required elements of the project with no known bugs remaining.  
  - I was able to refactor the code so that the functionality is simple with functions primarily handling one task at a time.   
- Challenges
  - The main challenge of this assignment was figuring out how to check for the variety of winning possibilities.  My refactored solution is similiar to a mathmatical proof checking on the value of three different element positions of an array within and array of possibilities.
