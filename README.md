### Wins + Challenges:

- Wins
  - We were able to complete all required iterations (0-4) with no known bugs remaining.  
  - We also added a couple of small enhancements.
  - We were able to set up a GitHub Project and organize the work using tickets so that we all knew what each of us was working on at any given time.  This also allowed us to more easily to keep track of completed and remaining work.   
  - We maintained strong communication throughout the project.  
- Challenges
  - Initially we experienced challenges around merge conflicts.
    - After unsuccessfully troubleshooting as a team we reached out to our instructors for guidance. Travis was able to point us in the correct direction. We then worked through subsequent merge conflicts together
